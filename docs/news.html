<p>Made the news, comments and login pages along with all the high-level faculty pages.</p>

<p>The Login page validates the user (at the moment, there's only one user called 'master') and we can move the '$_SESSION' variables around.</p>

<p>Updated button colors and sizes.</p>

<p>Got the about.php page up.</p>

<p>Got the news page up and running. Finally.</p>

<p>Did a whole ton of documentation to make things less confusing later.</p>
