# digital-book-of-lies
A web application for teachers and college faculty to track their coursework.
More details coming up later!

**Current version: 2.0**

This file contains details about the file-structure and organization, as well as about some other stuff to keep in mind when mucking around with this application.

Well, despite saying that, there really is no 'structure' at the moment. All files are in the root folder. The 'old' folder contains the previous working version of the site.

Also, at the moment, the site is just a prototype. Much of functionality hasn't actually been added in yet. Just an FYI.

**Current users:**
master - yoda
admin - bunnies

#Cutenews

This site uses CutePHP in a few places for stuff like the updates page and such.
